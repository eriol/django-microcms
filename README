django-microcms
===============

``django-microcms`` is a minimalistic enhancement of Django flatpages app. It
provides few additional fields and integrates CKeditor.

Installation
============

Assuming that you want to install ``django-microcms`` version 0.2.0:

From a packaged version::

    $ pip install http://downloads.mornie.org/django-microcms/django-microcms-0.2.0.tar.gz

From source repository::

    $ pip install -e hg+http://hg.mornie.org/django/microcms/@0.2.0#egg=django-microcms

Or download a packaged version from http://downloads.mornie.org/django-microcms/
and and use Python's ``distutils`` to install.

Getting started
===============

Previously you must have correctly set up Django ``flatpages``.

Simply add ``microcms`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` after ``flatpages``.

CKeditor integration
====================

Default settings assumes that CKeditor is available at
``STATIC_URL/ckeditor/ckeditor.js``. You can change it using CKEDITOR_URL in
your settings.py:

    CKEDITOR_URL = "path/to/ckeditor.js"

CKEDITOR_URL will be prepended with STATIC_URL so you can use a relative path.

You can need to add some custom css to fix displaying issues or to customize the
admin page. CKeditor kama theme, for example, doesn't look good without a fix,
but a custom css is provided by django-microcms itself: just use
``django-admin.py collectstatic`` to copy it into STATIC_ROOT.

If you want customize just use MICROCMS_CUSTOM_CSS in your settings.py:

    MICROCMS_CUSTOM_CSS = ('kama-fix.css',)

Don't forget to use a tuple: this is done to give greater flexibility. Again
values inside MICROCMS_CUSTOM_CSS will be prepended with STATIC_URL.



Thanks for downloading django-microcms.
