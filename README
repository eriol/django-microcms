django-microcms
===============

``django-microcms`` is a minimalistic enhancement of Django flatpages app. It
provides few additional fields and integrates CKeditor.

Installation
============

Assuming that you want to install ``microcms`` version 0.1.1:

From a packaged version::

    $ pip install -f http://downloads.mornie.org/django-microcms/django-microcms-0.1.1.tar.gz

From source repository::

    $ pip install -e hg+http://hg.mornie.org/django/microcms/@0.1.1#egg=django-microcms

Or download a packaged version from http://downloads.mornie.org/django-microcms/
and and use Python's ``distutils`` to install.

Getting started
===============

Previously you must have correctly set up Django ``flatpages``.

Simply add ``microcms`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` after ``flatpages``.

CKeditor integration
====================

Default settings assumes that CKeditor is available at
``MEDIA_URL/ckeditor/ckeditor.js``. You can change it using CKEDITOR_URL in
your settings.py:

    CKEDITOR_URL = "path/to/ckeditor.js"

CKEDITOR_URL will be prepended with MEDIA_URL so you can use a relative path.

You can need to add some custom css to fix displaying issues or to customize the
admin page. CKeditor kama theme, for example, doesn't look good without a fix.
Just use MICROCMS_CUSTOM_CSS in your settings.py:

    MICROCMS_CUSTOM_CSS = ('kama-fix.css',)

Don't forget to use a tuple: this is done to give greater flexibility. Again
values inside MICROCMS_CUSTOM_CSS will be prepended with MEDIA_URL.



Thanks for downloading django-microcms.
